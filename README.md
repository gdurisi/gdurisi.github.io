This is the repository containing my academic website, which can be accessed at the following [url](gdurisi.github.io).
The website uses the [minimal mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) Jekyll theme, developed by [Michael Rose](https://github.com/sponsors/mmistakes).
If you decide to fork this repository, rather than installing a pristine copy of this theme, using the detailed and simple to follow instructions
available [here](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/), please make sure to  modify/remove also the tracking-id number in the file
