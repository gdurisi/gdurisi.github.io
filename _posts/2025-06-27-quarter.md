## Presentations

I gave the following invited talks:

- "Theoretical Performance Guarantees for Partial Domain Adaptation via Partial Optimal Transport", Workshop in Advancements in High-Dimensional Methods for Machine Learning, Gothenburg, Sweden, May 2025

- "Packet and error detection for short-packet transmission", London Symposium on Information Theory, Cambridge, United Kingdom, May 2025

## Other updates

- I became member of the pan-European artificial intelligence network of excellence [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu), the European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems

- The team was well represented at this year [Göteborgsvarvet](https://www.goteborgsvarvet.se/en/), the world's largest half marathon (apparently), with around 50000 runners.
