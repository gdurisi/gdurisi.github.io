We have just uploaded to our [team's github repository](https://github.com/infotheorychalmers) the numerical routines to reproduce the results reported in two recently published journal papers:

> J. Ostman, A. Lancho, G. Durisi, and L. Sanguinetti, “URLLC with Massive MIMO: Analysis and Design at Finite Blocklength,” <em>IEEE Trans. Wireless Commun.</em>, 2021.  [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10550">arXiv</a>], [<a href="https://github.com/infotheorychalmers/URLLC_Massive_MIMO">matlab code</a>]

> J. Östman, R. Devassy, G. Durisi, and E. G. Ström, “Short-packet Transmission via Variable-Length Codes in the Presence of Noisy Stop Feedback,” <em>IEEE Trans. Wireless Commun</em>, 2021.  [<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01049">arXiv</a>], [<a href="https://github.com/infotheorychalmers/vlsf-bounds">matlab code</a>]
