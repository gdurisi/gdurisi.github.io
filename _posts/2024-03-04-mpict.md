Since April 2023, I have assumed the role of director of Chalmers **Master Program in**
**Information and Communication Technology** (**MPICT**), and now it is time again to advertise the
program to Chalmers bachelor students. 

I have collected here some useful information for our students, which complement the ones
available on the excellent [program website](https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/find-masters-programme/information-and-communication-technology-msc/).

## The goal of the program 

We live in a digital society, which is built on our ability to produce, transfer, store, and process
digital information, i.e., bits.
This program prepares you to become a digital-information engineer within the broad **information and**
**communication technology** (**ICT**) sector, 
We will provide you with both the analytical skills and the applied knowledge
required to imagine, design, and build the digital systems of the future.

## The information and communication technology sector at a glance 
So what is the **ICT sector**? It is good for you to know about it because, with very high
probability, it will be the sector you will work in after you will leave Chalmers. 
It is dynamic sector that evolves at an extremely rapid pace! It isthe fastest growing sector in the Gothenburg region (Västra
Götaland), where we have a world-class ecosystem consisting of large companies (Ericsson,
Saab, Volvo AB, Volvo Cars, CEVT,...), as well as of small companies and  start-ups. Currently, we have about 700
start ups employing around 15000 people in the region. 
This implies that there is a very strong demand for ICT engineers.

## The information and communication technology sector in Chalmers educational offer 

Let us dig a bit deeper into ICT: what are the current challenges---the ones you will most
likely encounter during your professional life?
Let me highlight six technologies around which most challenges, but also
opportunities lie: 

- **Digitalization**: companies want to digitalize/automatize their processes,
and benefit from customers data
- **Augmented reality**: it may disrupt the way in which people will interact with each other, both
in private and work sphere, as well as how they gather information and learn.
- **Wireless communications beyond 5G**: with  their enhanced and ubiquitous
connectivity and integrated localization and sensing, they will become integral part of many applications including smart infrastructures and
autonomous vehicle.
- **Internet of things**: a myriad of wirelessy connected, low-cost sensors will be
integrated in a network computation fabric, yielding real-time autonomous and
distributed decision systems.
- **Cyber security**: digital transformation is prone to cyber attacks. How shall we
defend it?
- **Artificial intelligence**: how to make AI replace humans in certain tasks?
It must be secure, explainable, and fair

These
technologies will shape the future we will leave in. But in which measure, it is still
unclear.  What will be the applications everyone will use in the next 5
years? Who will own them? 


Many master programs at Chalmers prepare you for a career within ICT, by focusing on a
subset of these technologies. For example, **MPSYS**, by highlighting the control perspective, exposes you to
the first 3 challenges. If you are interesting in hardware aspects related to next
generation communication infrastructure, then **MPWPS** is a great choice for you. **MPALG** takes
a software perspective, and exposes you to cyber-security, AI, and digitalization
challenges. Finally, if AI is what you are interested in, we have the data-science
program **MPDSC**.
**MPICT** is the only program, to the best of my knowledge, that exposes you to all these six
technologies. 
Why is it good to be broad? Because you will most likely change jobs multiple times
during your professional life and will move from one challenge to the next.
Furthermore, innovation often happens at the boundaries between
technologies. So it is good to see all of them if you are interested in disruption and
innovation (for example, you plan to have your own start-ups)!
# The MPICT program plan at a glance
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024/courses-schema.png" alt="">

The MPICT program entails 5 compulsory courses to get an overview of the current ICT challenges and a very 
broad selection of compulsory/elective, elective/courses to dig deeper into your favorite
technology. 
In the figure below, we listed the 27 compulsory-elective courses that are available in
the program, divided per study period.

To help you with your selections, the program is organized into the following 3 tracks:

- **Digital communication systems**: theoretic, algorithmic, and practical aspects of digital
  communication systems 
- **Intelligent information processing**: at the intersection of signal processing, sensing,
computer vision, and machine intelligence
- **Cognitive autonomous networks**: network design and automation, security aspects 


# Unique features of the MPICT programs

As it is common for most programs at Chalmers, the MPICT program trains you in problem solving
and critical thinking.
Team work and presentation skills are honed through different dedicated moments in both
compulsory and compulsory/elective courses.
What's unique is that you will be in close contact, if you wish, with a world-class
academic and industrial research environment. 
Also, most MPICT teachers belong to one of the largest research group in Europe in the field of
information and communication technologies: this implies plenty of industrial contacts, as well as 
many academic and industrial PhD positions available for the ones of you who are interested in doctoral studies. 

# Additional information 
I will soon upload a recorded version of a short presentation I gave to Chalmers bachelor
students this year.
