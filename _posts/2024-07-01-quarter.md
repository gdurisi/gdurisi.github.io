## Vacancies

- I am looking for a postdoctoral researcher interested in working on
[machine learning over wireless networks](https://www.chalmers.se/en/about-chalmers/work-with-us/vacancies/?rmpage=job&rmjob=12970). Deadline: **July 30, 2024**
- The call for [Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellowships](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/calls/msca-postdoctoral-fellowships-2024) will close on **September 11, 2024**. If you are interested in applying for this fellowship to join my team, please get in touch.

## Team Members

[Dr. Khac-Hoang Ngo](https://khachoang1412.github.io), who has been a postdoctoral researcher with our team over the last few
years, has secured a very prestigious assistant professor position at Linköping
University, in Sweden. Congratulations, Hoang!
