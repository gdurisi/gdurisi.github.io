At this year [IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory](https://2025.ieee-isit.org), our group will present two papers on
type-based unsourced multiple access (TUMA)---a framework for communication in unsourced
multiple access, which aims to collect and aggregate in an efficient way data from a
massive population of sporadically active users. In TUMA, the receiver is interested in both the set of transmitted messages and their multiplicities.
The goal is to estimate the empirical message distribution (type).

1. In the [first paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19916), we derive a novel achievability
   bound that quantifies the performance of TUMA over the Gaussian multiple-access
channel. We then use the bound to benchmark the performance achievable using coded
compressed sensing with approximate message passing.

2. In the [second paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19954), we extend the analysis of TUMA to fading environments with multiple antennas, leveraging the spatial diversity offered by distributed massive MIMO systems.

A high level presentation of the work we performed so far on the TUMA setup can be found
