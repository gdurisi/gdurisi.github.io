I've just got hold of a new Mac laptop to replace my previous one, which has started
showing signs of aging.
I thought it could be useful for the PhD students and postdoctoral researchers that will
join my group during the next months, and will decide to buy a Mac, to write down the
applications I like to install on every Mac I use, for my
academic work. The focus of this document will be only on applications that are available
for free. I use also proprietary software. But since this software can be found and
installed via well-documented
platforms provided by our university, there is little value in discussing it here.

In a series of future posts, I will also describe how I use all these applications.
The instructions below may contain errors, so use them at your own risk. If you find
some issues or discover that some information provided here is outdated, please let me know, and I will try
to rectify it.


## Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is a package manager for MacOS. Essentially, it allows one to install and update
applications similar to a Linux distribution.
We will use it to install and maintain many great tools.
To install homebrew follow the instructions on the [Homebrew website](https://brew.sh).
Note: the homebrew installer will also download and install the `Command Line Tools for
Xcode`, which are needed to compile source file.
Homebrew allows you also to keep all your packages updated. Just type in the terminal

    brew update
    brew outaded

To verify which of the installed packages have an update version available.
Then use

    brew upgrade

followed by the name of the desired package, to update it.


## Fonts for terminal and other applications

I like to use the font `Sauce code pro nerd font`  in some of my applications.
Let us install it via homebrew

    brew install --cask homebrew/cask-fonts/font-sauce-code-pro-nerd-font


## Kitty and terminal improvements

Let us replace the `terminal` app in the MAC with something that is more configurable. I
chose [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/), which we can install again via homebrew

    brew install --cask kitty

Kitty can be set up via a `.conf` configuration file, which needs to be placed in
`./config/kitty`.

Let us now make the use of the terminal (which is central in my academic work flow) a bit
more pleasant.
First of all, let us install [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/#install), a framework for managing zsh configurations, by following the instructions in their website.
Then let us use homebrew again to install [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#homebrew) to make the terminal look nicer:

    brew install romkatv/powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k
    echo "source $(brew --prefix)/opt/powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k.zsh-theme" >>~/.zshrc

A configuration wizard will guide you through the configuration options. You can restart
the wizard at any time by typing `p10k configure`

A tool that I use very often when working on the command line is [zsh-z](https://github.com/agkozak/zsh-z), which allows me
to jump quickly to directories that I have visited recently.
This is so much more convenient than navigating my file system using the `finder` app.
To activate this plugin, just open the file `.zshrc` in your home directory and replace
the line `plugin=(git)` with the line `plugin=(git z)`.


## Python

Let us now set up python, which has become an invaluable tool for both research and
teaching.
A brand new MacOS comes with its own version of python. I prefer to set one up myself for
a better control. The following instructions are taken from the following [excellent
article](https://opensource.com/article/19/5/python-3-default-mac).
Let us first use homebrew to install [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv), which we will use to manage the python versions.

    brew install pyenv

Then we use pyenv to install the desired version of python (the latest one being `python
3.12.1` at the time of writing)

    pyenv install 3.12.1

Finally, we set this version as default python version

    pyenv global 3.12.1

Finally, to have control on the shell path, type the following line command

    echo -e 'if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then\n  eval "$(pyenv init -)"\nfi' >> ~/.zshrc

which adds a similar line in the `.zshrc` file.


## Neovim

I currently use [neovim](https://neovim.io) as my editor for latex, markdown, sometimes python, and the various
configuration files. It integrates very well with my terminal flow.
It can as usual be installed via homebrew

    brew install neovim

Neovim is highly customizable (via the [Lua](https://www.lua.org) language), which may actually be an issue for
new users.
A good starting point is the following [configuration file](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim).
It configures autocompletion, language server protocols, snippets, themes, fuzzy finders, and more.
Once you start neovim, it is a good idea to run the function `:Checkhealth` to verify
whether additional packages should be installed.

## Tmux

[Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) is a terminal multiplexer, i.e., a tool to have multiple sessions, windows, and
panes in the terminal. I use Tmux to switch between multiple tasks effectively (e.g., writing a paper
and preparing some lecture notes), while keeping all the needed files opened the whole
time. This is particularly useful when working on a desktop computer, since I reboot it
rarely.
Tmux can be installed as usual via homebrew

    brew install tmux

Similar to the other programs, it can be configured via a config. file `.tmux.config` in the
home directory.


## Doom Emacs

I use emacs mainly to 

1. maintain my todo lists, keep track of deadlines, and progress
towards my objectives via the fantastic [org mode](https://orgmode.org) package, 
2. to
create and link research and management notes via [org-roam](https://www.orgroam.com), and 
3. to keep track of interesting papers to read via
[elfeed](https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed), produce notes linked to the articles via
[citar](https://github.com/emacs-citar/citar) and link articles to my notes via [org-cite](https://orgmode.org/manual/Citations.html).

Emacs is highly customizable. I find [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs) an excellent configuration framework,
which can be used as a good starting point for customizing emacs. It also uses vim
keybindings, which fits my flow nicely.
Also it installs automatically most of the packages I need and it configures them reasonably.
To install a version of Emacs for macOS that plays well with the Doom Emacs framework,
use the following commands 

    brew tap railwaycat/emacsmacport
    brew install --cask emacs-mac

Then proceed as described [here.](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/blob/master/docs/getting_started.org#doom-emacs)
Doom emacs requires `ripgrep` and `fd` for fast file search. You can install both of them
via homebrew

    brew install ripgrep fd

Additional programs (to be installed via `homebrew`) may be useful; run `doom doctor` to figure out
what else you may want to install 

## Latex

To install latex on macOS, I use [MacTeX.](https://www.tug.org/mactex/)
It also installs by default [Bibdesk](https://bibdesk.sourceforge.io), which is an excellent `.bib` file manager.
I use it also to archive in an effective way the `.pdf` of the papers saved in my `.bib` file.
It also integrates well with doom emacs, provided that citation keys and pdf names are synchronized. 


## Skim

Skim is a simple pdf reader that integrates well with latex, syntex, and pdfsync.
This means that it supports both forward and inverse search when used as output of the
compilation of a `.tex` file.
As usual, it can be installed using homebrew

    brew install --cask skim

I have tried other pdf readers: some of them such as [zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/plugins/) allow for dark background and
vim keybindings. However, I find them less stable than skim on MacOS when used together with neovim.
Of course, one can use doom emacs to edit latex as well (with its native pdf reader), but I find neovim somewhat more
convenient to use for my flow.


## Unison

One issue with having a desktop computer together with a laptop, is that I need to keep
them synchronized. To do so, I use [Unison](https://github.com/bcpierce00/unison).
It can as usual be installed via homebrew

    brew install unison

To use unison, one needs to create a profile file and place it in `/Library/Application
Support/Unison`
The profile file is a `.prf` file that contains information related to the machine
that need to be synchronized as well as a list of directories over which the program will
act and of files extensions to ignore.
