This week I participated to the [TUM-COM Workshop on Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications and Applications for 5G](https://www.lkn.ei.tum.de/tum-graduate-school-workshop-2018/), which took place in one of the most scenic locations I've ever given a talk in: the [Schneefernerhaus research station](https://www.schneefernerhaus.de/en/home.html) close to the top of the Zugspitze in Germany.

My slides can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13l0raGzO8-Tov0qAXxYvmlBthCoeyTwe).
