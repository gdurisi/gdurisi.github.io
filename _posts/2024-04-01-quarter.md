## Team members

- We currently have many openings in our department at both PhD and post-doctoral levels.
 Please have a look at [Chalmers vacancy website](https://www.chalmers.se/en/about-chalmers/work-with-us/vacancies/) (select vacancies at the Department of Electrical Engineering) for more information. I will also 
announce soon a post-doctoral position and a PhD position in my team. 

- The call for [Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellowships](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships) will open on April 23, 2024. If you are interested in applying for this
fellowship to join my team, please get in touch. 


## Teaching

- If you are a Chalmers or international bachelor student looking for a master program,
please check [this webpage]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-03-04-mpict %}) about our master program in Information and Communication
Technology. 
A recorded version of a short presentation I gave to Chalmers bachelor
students at the beginning of March is available [here](https://youtu.be/P3yUHEjdeQw).
