The [Swedish Research Council](http://vr.se) has approved our project entitled *energy-efficient massive random access 
for real time distributed autonomous systems*. 
This 4MSEK project, which will run from 2022 to 2025 has the following premise:
To support the Internet-of-Things (IoT) vision of enabling distributed autonomous systems able to 
operate in real time, we need a new wireless infrastructure, providing connectivity to a massive
number of sporadically active and energy-limited devices, which access the wireless medium in an
uncoordinated fashion. Indeed, current wireless systems are provably unable to provide low-latency,
energy-efficient communications in the presence of massive uncoordinated interference.

The purposed of this project is to obtain an information-theoretic characterization of the maximum
energy efficiency at which quality-of-service targets that are relevant for real-time decision making 
can be achieved. Guided by the insights provided by this characterization, we will then design novel, low-complexity, 
massive random-access protocols, able to operate close to the predicted theoretical limits.
The project involves the following novel elements: we will
1. explicitly account, via the use of nonasymptotic tools from information theory, for the small payload size of IoT packets;
2. address [practically relevant](https://github.com/gdurisi/asilomar-challenge) IoT scenarios, in which the devices have heterogeneous requirements 
in terms energy efficiency and quality of service;
3. consider new metrics beyond packet error probability, which take into account the value of the information carried by each packet;
4. use techniques from machine learning, to disentangle packet collisions by exploiting commonly-observed traffic patterns.

This project will be conducted together with my colleague at Chalmers, Prof. [Alexandre Graell i Amat](https://sites.google.com/site/agraellamat/), and my long-term collaborator at the 
German Aerospace Center, [Dr. Gianluigi Liva](https://www.wirelesscoding.org).
