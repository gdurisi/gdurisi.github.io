On Nov. 3, the first (virtual) [reporting workshop](https://www.chalmers.se/en/centres/chair/events/Pages/CHAIR-Annual-Workshop-2020.aspx) of Chalmers AI research centre (CHAIR) took place.
We had more than 40 presentations of ongoing research projects financed or partly financed by CHAIR, 5 presentations from our external core partners (CEVT, Ericsson, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Volvo Cars, and Volvo Group), and one inspiring keynote talk on the subject advancing AI for social impact by Professor [Milind Tambe](https://teamcore.seas.harvard.edu/people/milind-tambe), professor of computer science at Harvard University, director of center for research in computation and society, and also director of "AI for Social Good" at Google Research India.
A video recording of the workshop will soon be posted online. 

Here are some reflections from the seminar:

- I was impressed by the amount and quality of novel AI research in both foundational and applied aspects that the centre was able to stimulate over its first 2 years of existence. 

- Through the center, we were able to leverage the faculty recruitment opportunities enabled by the generous funding provided by [WASP](https://wasp-sweden.org) to attract excellent young researchers to Chalmers. 
The centre is providing a great opportunity for these young researchers to familiarize themselves with the Chalmers research environment and to establish close connections with our external partners. 

- Close collaboration between CHAIR and Chalmers Gender Initiative for Excellence (GENIE) resulted in concrete steps towards increasing gender balance in the AI area at Chalmers.

The workshop was also helpful in identifying some of the challenges ahead for our Centre:

- The AI research at Chalmers is still quite scattered and it appears natural to consolidate some of the research activities currently conducted at Chalmers by different research groups within the same broad area (e.g., foundational aspects of AI, AI for transport systems, ...) in few, well-defined research programs. 
Performing such a consolidation, which will require some form of prioritization, is going to be very important for the future of our centre, also from the perspective of attracting additional external prestigious research grants. 

- We have now a strong participation of external research partners within the Centre. It will be important to define with them relevant research programs that are of interest to many external partners at the same time.  
The upcoming call for [CHAIR consortium projects](https://www.chalmers.se/en/centres/chair/news/Pages/Call-for-CHAIR-Consortium-Projects-2021.aspx) will give us the first opportunity to make solid progress in this direction. 

- AI technology is becoming more and more an integral tool in many research disciplines. Our [data-science research engineers](https://www.chalmers.se/en/areas-of-advance/ict/research/big-data/Pages/Data-science-and-application-experts.aspx) have done an excellent job in providing AI support to many research groups all over Chalmers (and more recently, also externally, within Chalmers efforts in providing support to our regional institutions during the Covid-19 pandemic). But there are still many research groups at Chalmers that are not currently part of the CHAIR ecosystems, which are actively using AI methods in their research areas, or are interested in applying them. 
Including them in an effective way will be crucial for our Centre to create the expected synergies. 








<!-- Over the last eight months, I have been working together with many colleagues in the [Information and Communication Technology Area of Advance](https://www.chalmers.se/en/areas-of-advance/ict/Pages/default.aspx[]()) at Chalmers on the creation of a new Chalmers competence center for artificial intelligence (CHAIR).

The objectives of this centre are (i) to strengthen AI research core at Chalmers, (ii) to establish applied research activities in strategic areas such as autonomous driving and industrial automation, and (iii) to support educational activities within AI.


This week, we learnt that Chalmers Foundation decided to [support this center](http://www.chalmers.se/sv/styrkeomraden/ikt/nyheter/Sidor/Chalmers-satsar-kraftfullt-inom-AI.aspx) with a significant investment of 317 MSEK (about 31 MEUR) over the period 2019-2028. Together with the expected investment from industries, the total budget of the center may end up being twice as big.

Today, we had a [seminar](http://www.chalmers.se/en/areas-of-advance/ict/news/Pages/AI-at-Chalmers-seminar.aspx) to present CHAIR and its relation to other ongoing national initiatives related to AI in Sweden, including [WASP](http://wasp-sweden.org[]()), the announced investment from the Swedish government on continuous [education](https://www.chalmers.se/sv/nyheter/Sidor/Nationell-utbildningssatsning-inom-AI.aspx) within AI, and the [AI arena & data factory](https://www.regeringen.se/pressmeddelanden/2018/05/sverige-skapar-en-internationellt-ledande-samverkansmiljo-for-ai/) to be established at the Lindholmen Science Park in Gothenburg.

Here are some reflections from the seminar:

- The large investments allocated to AI from different founding sources shows a clear commitment from Sweden to be among the excellence centers in the world within this field. Great to see that Chalmers Foundation strongly supports this vision.

 
- Industries in Sweden are investing in AI, and clearly recognize the importance of working closely to universities. Chalmers has a unique ability to collaborate with industries, through its research centers, and through the [area of advance](https://www.chalmers.se/en/areas-of-advance/Pages/default.aspx) structure.  CHAIR can leverage this to impact not only research and education, but also innovation.


- It is impressive to see how the simultaneous recruitment of PhD students, spurred by the last wasp-ai-math call,  has facilitated the dialog between faculty members at three different departments: math, electrical engineering, and computer science. We will soon have a joint seminar course and a couple of new PhD courses jointly taught by faculty at different departments. Imagine which synergies we can achieve once CHAIR is in place!


CHAIR will allow Chalmers to expand its operations in AI. This includes recruitment at faculty level.
