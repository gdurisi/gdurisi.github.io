What are the best performing coding schemes for the transmission of short packets?

Check out our [<kbd>recent survey</kbd>](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.08562), where we benchmark the performance of algebraic, polar, LDPC codes and more against modern performance bounds from nonasymptotic information theory.
