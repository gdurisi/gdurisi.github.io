[Fredrik Hellström](https://www.chalmers.se/en/staff/Pages/Fredrik-Hellstrom.aspx) has joined our team as Ph.D. student. The goal of his project is to shed lights on the remarkable generalization performance of deep neural networks. This will be done using  mathematical tools from various fields including optimization and information theory. I'll be involved in the project as supervisor, together with my colleague [Fredrik Kahl](http://www.maths.lth.se/matematiklth/personal/fredrik/index.html), head of the computer vision group at Chalmers, who will act as co-supervisor.

Fredrik Hellström holds a master degree in Physics from Gothenburg University. In his master thesis, he explored dark matter models and their possible interaction with standard particles. Welcome, Fredrik!
