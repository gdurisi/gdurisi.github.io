We will present the following two papers at this year NeurIPS conference 

- F. Hellström and G. Durisi, "Evaluated CMI bounds for meta learning: Tightness and expressiveness," in Conf. Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), New Orleans, LA, U.S.A., Nov. 2022.

- F. Hellström and G. Durisi, “A new family of generalization bounds using sample- wise evaluated CMI,” in Conf. Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), New Orleans, LA, U.S.A., Nov. 2022.

More details will follow once these two paper will be made public.
