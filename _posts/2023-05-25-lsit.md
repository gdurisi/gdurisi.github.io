It was a pleasure to give an invited talk in the invited session "massive access
systems"
organized by [Petar Popovski](https://petarpopovski.es.aau.dk), at this year 2023 [London Symposium on Information
Theory](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/lsit-2023-seventh-london-symposium-information-theory)

In the talk, presented an overview of recent information-theoretic results that
provide a characterization of the largest energy efficiency achievable in the
so-called unsourced massive multiple access scenario, where a large number of
sporadically active devices access the wireless medium in an uncoordinated
fashion. I will also discuss extensions of this scenario to the case in which
the number of active devices is random and unknown to the receiver, and to the
case in which the devices transmit heterogeneous traffic consisting of both
standard and critical messages.

If you are interested in this talk, I recorded one of my [dry
runs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JW0i132qlro).
The slides I presented in the video contain a couple of typos (can you spot
them?)
An updated version of the slides is available [here](/files/2023/05-lsit.pdf) and the simulation code
that we used to produce most of the results is on [github](https://github.com/khachoang1412/UMA_random_user_activity)

The two papers the presentation is built upon are:

-  K.-H. Ngo, A. Lancho, G. Durisi, and A. Graell i Amat, “Unsourced multiple access with random user activity,”  IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 2023, to appear, [[pdf]](arxiv.org/abs/2202.06365) 

- K.-H. Ngo, G. Durisi, A. G. i. Amat, P. Popovski, A. E. Kalor, and B. Soret, “Unsourced multiple access with common alarm messages: Network slicing for massive and critical IoT,” Feb. 2023 [[pdf]](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11026)
