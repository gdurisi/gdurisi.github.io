## Publications 
During this quarter, the following paper from my team has been accepted for
publication:

- Y. Ettefagh, S. R. Aghdam, G. Durisi, S. Jacobsson, M. Coldrey, and C. Studer, “Performance of quantized massive MIMO with fronthaul rate constraint over quasi-static channels,” IEEE ACCESS, vol. 11, 2023.
 

## Team members 

 [Deekshith P. K.](https://www.chalmers.se/en/persons/deepat/) has joined our team as postdoctoral researcher. He holds a
  Ph.D. degree from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India. 
  He will work mainly on information theoretic limits and
  coding schemes for massive random access.

## Talks

I've given a keynote talk at the massive random access session of the [London
Symposium on Information Theory](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/lsit-2023-seventh-london-symposium-information-theory) 

If you are interested in this talk, I recorded one of my [dry
runs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JW0i132qlro).
The slides I presented in the video contain a couple of typos (can you spot
them?)
An updated version of the slides is available [here](/files/2023/05-lsit.pdf) and the simulation code
that we used to produce most of the results is on [github](https://github.com/khachoang1412/UMA_random_user_activity).
