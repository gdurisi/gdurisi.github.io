The Swedish Research Council has approved our project ``**Communication in time: theory and practice for the automated society**''. 
The project is lead by my colleague Prof. [Erik Str√∂m](https://www.chalmers.se/en/staff/Pages/erik-strom.aspx) at the Communication System Group (Chalmers). 
Prof. [Urbashi Mitra](http://ceng.usc.edu/~ubli/ubli.html) at USC and myself are co-PIs. 

The goal of the project is to acquire knowledge about fundamental limits and design principles for wireless communication systems with guarantees on timely delivery of data. We will focus on the important and challenging case of sporadic transmissions of short packets, as this is urgently needed for emerging applications in automated driving, factory automation, health care, and other critical applications.

A PhD student will be recruited within the project. The vacancy will be announced shortly
