## Team members 

- Fredrik Hellström has successfully defended his [PhD thesis]({% post_url 2023-01-19-fredrik-phd %}) on January 19, 2023  and remained in the
  group as a post-doctoral researcher during this quarter. He has been recently awarded a
  prestigious postdoctoral fellowship from the [Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program](www.wasp-sweden.org) and will join [Benjamin Guedj](https://bguedj.github.io)'s
  group at University College London in May as postdoctoral fellow.

- Jayadev Naram has joined our team in January as PhD student working on
  information-theoretic generalization bounds. He received his Master of Science---Dual Degree in  Computer Science and Engineering---from the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, India. 
  His PhD project is supported by a grant from the [Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program](www.wasp-sweden.org).

- We will soon announce another PhD student vacancy within our [SAICOM]({% post_url 2022-09-16-saicom %}) project on machine learning for wireless communication.

## Talks

I've participated to the [Information Theory and Tapas
  Workshop](https://itt.webs.tsc.uc3m.es/program/) organized by Prof. Tobias
  Koch in January 2023, Madrid, Spain. There, I presented a talk entitled "*Seeking
  information-theoretic bounds that explain generalization*". The slides of
  the talk are available on the workshop website.

## Other 
I became director of Chalmers Master Program in Information and Communication
Technologies ([MPICT](https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/find-masters-programme/information-and-communication-technology-msc/))
