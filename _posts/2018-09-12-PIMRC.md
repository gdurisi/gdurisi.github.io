This week, I've attended [PIMRC](http://pimrc2018.ieee-pimrc.org/) in  Bologna, Italy, where I gave an invited presentation in the special session entitled ``Small-data networks'' organized by my colleagues Enrico Paolini (University of Bologna, Italy),
Gianluigi Liva, (DLR, Germany) and Andrea Munari, RWTH Aachen University, Germany.

The intriguing idea of the session was to reflect on the challenges brought to communication systems by the need to support machine-type communications and their unique traffic characteristics: massive number of sporadically active users, short-packet transmissions, and---for some applications---low latency combined with high reliability requirements.

The slides of my presentation, entitled ``Fundamentals of short-packet transmissions'' can be downloaded [here](https://www.slideshare.net/GiuseppeDurisi/18-09pirmc).
