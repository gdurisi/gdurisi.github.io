excerpt: "Finite-blocklength information theory is an indispensable toolbox for the design of short-packet communication systems. In an invited presentation at this year [IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications](http://pimrc2018.ieee-pimrc.org/), I explained what one can do with this toolbox.

This week, I've attended [PIMRC](http://pimrc2018.ieee-pimrc.org/) in  Bologna, Italy, where I gave an invited presentation in the special session entitled ``Small-data networks'' organized by my colleagues Enrico Paolini (University of Bologna, Italy),
Gianluigi Liva, (DLR, Germany) and Andrea Munari, RWTH Aachen University, Germany.

The intriguing idea of the session was to reflect on the challenges brought to communication systems by the need to support machine-type communications and their unique traffic characteristics: massive number of sporadically active users, short-packet transmissions, and---for some applications---low latency combined with high reliability requirements.

The slides of my presentation, entitled ``Fundamentals of short-packet transmission'' can be downloaded [here](https://www.slideshare.net/GiuseppeDurisi/18-09pirmc).

The goal of my presentation was to illustrate in simple terms how finite-blocklength information theory can help us with the design of communication systems that transmit short packets and are subject to sometimes stringent latency and reliability constraints. I believe that finite-blocklength information theory is an indispensable toolbox for physical and network layer researchers working with IoT applications.
