## Team updates

Two excellent additions to our team!

- Emmanuella Ametzi, PhD student: started in June 2025; topic:  Runtime safe monitors for automotive ML-based functions; main supervisor: [Christian Berger](https://www.gu.se/en/about/find-staff/christianberger)

- Ziyong Cheong, PhD student: started in Sep. 2025; topic: understanding transformers via compression and discrimination

Furthermore, Lise Aabel has successfully [defended her PhD thesis](https://bsky.app/profile/chalmerscomsys.bsky.social/post/3lzy3kagblk2c), and  has now joined
Ericsson Research here in Gothenburg; Congratulation, Lise!  

- Lise Aabel (Chalmers 2025): Distributed Antenna Systems Using 1-bit Radio-Over-Fiber [[PhD thesis](https://research.chalmers.se/en/publication/548000)]

## Funding

The Swedish research council has approved our network grant for planning future excellent clusters for
 groundbreaking technologies; the title is ``Wireless beyond standardization''. The
principal investigator is [James Gross](https://www.kth.se/profile/jamesgr) from KTH and I will act as one of the
co-investigators.

## Other updates

I tried for the first time the very Swedish sport of
[swimrun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimrun). It combines trail running and swimming: what an interesting way to explore the Swedish nature!
I went for a [small race](https://www.skatassjoar.se/banstrackning/) for beginners; it
was a lot of fun!
