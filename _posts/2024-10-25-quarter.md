## Publications

During this quarter, the following papers from my team have been accepted for publication:

- A. E. Kalør, G. Durisi, S. Coleri, S. Parkvall, W. Yu, A. Mueller, and P. Popovski, “Wireless 6G connectivity for massive number of devices and critical services,” Proc. IEEE, 2024, to appear, [<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01127v2"><i class="fas fa-book"></i></a>]

- A. O. Kislal, M. Rajiv, G. Durisi, E. G. Ström, and U. Mitra, “Is synchronization a bottleneck for pilot-assisted URLLC links?,” IEEE Trans. Wireless Commun., 2024, to appear, [<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09089"><i class="fas fa-book"></i></a>]

## Team Members

- [Dr. Khac-Hoang Ngo](https://khachoang1412.github.io), who has been a postdoctoral researcher with our team over the last few
years, has Linköping
University as assistant professor, in Sweden. Congratulations, Hoang!

- In a fair exchange, [Dr. Unnikrishnan Kunnath Ganesan](https://www.chalmers.se/en/persons/kunnathg/) has joined the team as postdoctoral
researcher from Linköping University, where he got his PhD degree. He will work on machine
learning over wireless communication networks

- [Bingcheng Chen](https://www.chalmers.se/en/persons/chenbin/) has joined the team as
PhD student. He got his master degree from Chalmers. [Prof. Christian Häger](https://chaeger.github.io) will serve
as main supervisor, whereas I will serve as co-supervisor.
Bingcheng will work on data-driven methods to improve wireless communications.

## Teaching

During this quarter, I have been teaching two courses at Chalmers:

- [MVE137](https://chalmers.instructure.com/courses/30791/assignments/syllabus): Probability and statistical learning using Python
- [EEN100](https://chalmers.instructure.com/courses/30858/assignments/syllabus): Statistics and machine learning in high dimensions

In spite of its theoretical nature, the second course has registered a record high number of participants (49)

## Service

- I joined the board of the [Transactions on Information Theory](https://www.itsoc.org/it-trans) as Associate Editor

- I served as a reviewer for the call "International postdoc within natural engineering
and sciences" from the [Swedish Research Council](https://www.vr.se/english.html)
