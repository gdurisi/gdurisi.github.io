The [Swedish Foundation for strategic research](http://vr.se) has approved our project entitled [SAICOM: Software artificial intelligence for communication](https://strategiska.se/forskning/pagaende-forskning/ssf-future-software-systems-fuss-2021/projekt/11632/). 
This 35MSEK project is lead by Prof. [Carlo Fischione](https://people.kth.se/~carlofi/) at KTH, and involves [senior researchers](https://framtidensforskning.se/2022/06/17/bryter-ny-vetenskaplig-mark-for-framtidens-smarta-samhalle/) at KTH, Chalmers, and Gothenburg University.

The objective of this project is to develop machine learning algorithms for 6G networks, 
with specific focus on access protocols at the low layers, and services at the application layers that are 
particularly sensitive to low-layer performance.
The project will be concerned with the design of machine-learning algorithms 

1. that are able to run efficiently over open radio access networks (O-RAN), and/or
2. that can be use to operate and manage O-RAN.

Within this project, a number of PhD and post-doctoral students will be recruited at the three universities.
We currently have [two PhD-student vacancies](/vacancies) in our group. 
The two students will be jointly supervised by Ass. Professor [Christian HÃ¤ger](https://www.chalmers.se/en/staff/Pages/christian-hager.aspx), and by Prof. Giuseppe Durisi.
