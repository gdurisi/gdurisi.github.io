[Dr. Gianluigi Liva](http://www.wirelesscoding.org) (German Areospace Center--DLR), [Fabian Steiner](https://www.lnt.ei.tum.de/en/people/doctoral-researchers/steiner/) (Technical University of Munich, Germany), and I will give a tutorial on *Short-packet transmission: fundamentals and practical coding schemes* at [Globecom 2018](http://globecom2018.ieee-globecom.org)

In the tutorial, we review the fundamental tradeoff between throughput and reliability when transmitting short packets, using recently-developed tools in Ô¨Ånite-blocklength information theory. We also describe state-of-the-art code constructions (involving binary/nonbinary LDPC and turbo codes, polar codes, and tailbiting convolutional codes) for the short-block regime, and compare their performance with nonasymptotic information-theoretic limits.

The latest version of the slides of our tutorial can be downloaded [here](/files/2018/Globecom_Tutorial_2018.pdf).
