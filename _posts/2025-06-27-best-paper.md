- U. K. Ganesan, G. Durisi, M. Zecchin, P. Popovski, and O. Simeone, “Online conformal
compression for zero-delay communication with distortion guarantees,” in <em>Proc. IEEE
Int. Symp. Inf. Theory (ISIT), Learn to Compress & Compress to Learn Workshop</em>,
Ann Arbor, MI, USA, June 2025. [<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08340"><i class="fas fa-book"></i></a>]

was selected as **best paper** at the 2025 International Conference on Information Theory
Workshop "[Learn to Compress and Compress to Learn](https://learn-to-compress-workshop-isit.github.io)".

The idea of the paper is to revisit the problem of lossy source compression for the case
in which both encoder and decoder are equipped with an arbitrary pre-trained sequence predictor (say a
large-language model).
We present a novel algorithm, referred to as online conformal compression, which
leverages online conformal prediction, and comes with a guaranteed deterministic
per-sequence upper bound on the distortion.
