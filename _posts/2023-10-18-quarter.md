## Team members 
  [Alireza Bordbar](https://www.chalmers.se/en/persons/bordbar/) and [Kaan Okumus](https://www.chalmers.se/en/persons/okumus/) have joined our team.
  - Alireza, who got a master degree from Iran University of Science and Technology (Iran), will work on machine learning for wireless communications.
  - Kaan, who got a master degree from EPFL (Switzerland), will work on goal-oriented communications

## Teaching
