In this blog post I will provide some updates on my team's members as well as on the research topics my team is currently involved in:

Currently, my team is involved in research projects related to the following three topics

- Short-packet transmissions

- Distributed massive MIMO architectures involving low-cost hardware components 

- Information-theoretic generalization bounds for modern machine learning algorithms


### short-packet transmission

Alejandro (Wasp expedition project)

Recent contribution on massive MIMO for URLLC

Johan graduated!

FLB notes in a simple form


Example of a [good description](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~scarlett/research.html) of current research activities


### distributed massive MIMO architectures involving low-cost hardware components

- Lise industrial PhD project + video asilomar (is it public? Shall we make it public? I think so!)

- Oversampling vs size of antenna array (Anzhong)


### information-theoretic generalization bounds for modern machine learning algorithms

Very exciting new line of research (WASP + CHAIR)

- accepted paper

- ICLR updates
