### PhD student vacancies

<!-- - [**Jan. 2020**] PhD student position available: ``[generalization bounds for deep neural network: design and insights](https://www.chalmers.se/en/about-chalmers/Working-at-Chalmers/Vacancies/Pages/default.aspx?rmpage=job&rmjob=8281)''. Deadline: **Mar. 6, 2020**. Note: this is part of a broad recruitment at Chalmers in the field of mathematics for artificial intelligence. A total of six PhD students will be recruited. -->

- We will soon announce three PhD vacancies: one in the area of information-theoretic bounds in statistical learning theory, and two in the area of machine-learning algorithms for/over communication networks. 

- For other openings at every level at the Department of Electrical Engineering, please visit [Chalmers vacancy website](http://www.chalmers.se/en/about-chalmers/vacancies/Pages/default.aspx)

### Post-doctoral vacancies

<!-- - [**Jan. 2020**] I am looking for a postdoctoral researcher interested in working on the following project: ``[resilient and secure delay-critical edge computing](https://www.chalmers.se/en/about-chalmers/Working-at-Chalmers/Vacancies/Pages/default.aspx?rmpage=job&rmjob=8237&rmlang=UK)''. Deadline (extended): **Feb. 29, 2020** -->

<!-- - [**Nov. 2018**] I have two postdoctoral vacancies in the field of [secure and private machine-type communications](http://www.chalmers.se/en/about-chalmers/Working-at-Chalmers/Vacancies/Pages/default.aspx?rmpage=job&rmjob=6928) and [information-theoretic methods for deep learning](http://www.chalmers.se/en/about-chalmers/Working-at-Chalmers/Vacancies/Pages/default.aspx?rmpage=job&rmjob=6918)); deadline for applications: **January 5, 2019**. -->
