June. 2024: [Postdoctoral researcher position available in my team](/vacancies){: .btn .btn--danger}

# About

My research area is information theory, a mathematical discipline that deals with optimal methods for representing, communicating and storing digital information.
I'm currently interested in a broad range of topics:

- the characterization of the trade-off between latency, reliability and throughput in the transmission of digital information over both wireless and optical fiber channels

- the design of next-generation broadband cellular systems operating on the millimeter-wave part of the wireless spectrum and relying on advanced massive multi-antenna solutions

- the development of  low-latency ultra-reliable communication systems.

- the development of a theory able to explain the astounding performance of deep neural networks.

# Vision

I strive  to find mathematically elegant solutions to practically relevant engineering problems in the field of information transmission and processing.  Aiming for clarity and precision as well as making my research reproducible are among  my top priorities.
